A simple yet powerful tensorboard event log parser/reader:

* Supports parsing tensorboard event :ref:`scalars <tbparse_parsing-scalars>`,
  :ref:`tensors <tbparse_parsing-tensors>`,
  and :ref:`histograms <tbparse_parsing-histograms>`.
* Supports event generated by
  `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html>`_,
  `Tensorboard / Keras <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`_,
  and `TensorboardX <https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX>`_,
  with their respective usage examples documented in detail.
* Allows parsing multiple tensorboard event files in a hierarchical directory structure.
* Provides plotting examples for each type of events.
* Stores the data in
  `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_
  to allow advanced filtering.
* Both the documentation and code have high test coverage rate.
* Follows `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_ with full type hints.

Installation: (Requires python >= 3.7)

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -U tbparse

We suggest using an additional virtual environment for parsing and plotting
the tensorboard events. So no worries if your training code uses Python 3.6
or older versions. 

Reading one or more event files with tbparse only requires 5 lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

   from tbparse import SummaryReader
   log_dir = "<PATH_TO_EVENT_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY>"
   reader = SummaryReader(log_dir)
   df = reader.scalars
   print(df)

For beginners, start from the page: :ref:`tbparse_parsing-scalars`.
